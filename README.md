# RRT Path Planner 🤖
## Introduction 🌟

This project implements a path planner using RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) and PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) algorithms! Developed entirely from scratch using CSS, HTML, and JS, this project emerged as a delightful exploration into robotics and algorithms. You can try the demo of the algorithm here.

## Goals 🎯

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an interactive platform to visualize and understand RRT and PRM path planning algorithms.

Users can:

- Drag start and end points on a maze.
- Customize algorithm parameters.
- Witness the algorithm finding the optimal path between these points in real-time.

## Work Done 🛠️

The development of this RRT and PRM Path Planner project involved a comprehensive process, building each component from the ground up. Key steps include:

- Creating Fundamental Classes: Building classes for the search tree to efficiently explore and store potential paths.
- Node Addition: Implementing the process of adding nodes to the tree accurately, with extensive debugging to ensure precision.
- Designing Heuristic Function: Crafting a heuristic function to guide the algorithm's decision-making process.
- User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and interactive UI, allowing users to drag start and end points and customize algorithm parameters seamlessly.

## Results 📊

Adjusting parameters such as the number of closest neighbors, minimum threshold distance, maximum step size, and simulation speed significantly impacts the algorithm's behavior. Users can observe how these adjustments influence the efficiency and optimality of the path discovered by the RRT and PRM algorithms.
